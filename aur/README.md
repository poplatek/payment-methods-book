# Aur

Aus is an Icelandic mobile payment solution. It debits a debit or credit card and transfers that money to a bank account. Debit payments are free of charge, credit payments have a charge attached to them. Aur does not store card information.

Aur seems to support Android and iPhone.

# Background

Iceland already had a banking system that allowed for instant money transfers from one bank's account to another. Apparently, this had slowed the adaption of mobile payments in the country.
