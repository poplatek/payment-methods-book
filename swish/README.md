# Swish

# About

Swish is effectively a Sweden and SEK only solution for mobile payment. It is the major player in Sweden. It has both strengths and weaknesses due to how it has been implemented. Balancing the issue of being Sweden&SEK only, the payments are always instant and you can see the payees name on the mobile phone screen when you're paying.

# Features

- pay to friends, companies, organisations
- give to charity
- split bills
- ecommerce
- can be embedded to other apps
- QR-code initiated purchases
- instant payments to any of the participating banks
- supports 50 character payment messages

## Strengths

- Instant payments across the board
- Can see the payees name while paying

## Weaknesses

- Sweden only
- SEK only
- The mobile to mobile payment process seems rather complex due to the requirement of having both the Swish and the Bank ID app on the phone, acting as master at different times of the payment process.

Due to depending on the Swedish BankID Swish is effectively Swedish only albeit this is precisely why it supports instant payments across all participating banks and showing payee names during payment.
