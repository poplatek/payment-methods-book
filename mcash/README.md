mCash is one of the three major Norwegian payment applications. However, mCash stated in the 30th of June in 2017 that it shuts down in 1st of September of 2017.

mCash explained rationale for shutting down was that a common solution is now being sought out by 107 banks in order to deliver a single solution for all Norwegian bank customers.

The owner of mCash, SparBank1, that had acquired mCash earlier prompted the mCash users to join Vipps.

mCash was started in 2014 and had 430 000 unique users in 2016.
