# Collaborations

## MobilePay and Swish

MobilePay is trying to get into a collaboration with Swish. If this succeeds MobilePay has added another major player - and in large part - Sweden under its umbrella solutions for the Nordics. Also, due to the differing currencies between countries there may be an opportunity for MobilePay and Swish to make money from the currency conversions when payments are being made from one currency to another.

## Norwegian defence pact

DNB owned Vipps won the Norwegian market and to fend off non-Norwegians from the Norwegian mobile paying scene DNB spun off Vipps making itself the controlling (52%) owner of Vipps while 107 of other Norwegian banks now own the rest (48%) of Vipps.

mCASH used to a competitor to Vipps, but it is now part of Vipps, leaving Vipps the major player in Norway's mobile payments market.
