## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

European Union ratified GDPR during April 2016. There is a two year
period for member states to implement it to national law. Therefore,
companies are expected to be fully complient with it by May 25th 2018.

The reason for this legislation is that identity thefts have increased
and privacy is not at good enough level in internet services. The
legislation tries to guarantee personal privacy for EU citizen for
example when using online services.

GDPR is about EU citizen. All companies collecting data about EU
citizen must follow the rules. The rules are same for all EU and give
citizen better controls for personal data. There is no distinction on
private, public, and work related data.

Personal data is any information relating or identifying a natural
person. This means for example name, a photo, an email address, bank
details, medical information, IP addresses, or cookies, if they can be mapped to a
individual person.

Companies that do not follow the rules, can get big penalties, upto 20
million euros or 4 percent of global gross turn over. In case of a
data breach, companies must notify within 72 hours. 

Companies are expected to implement technical and organizational
measures to keep data
protected. For example, these technical measures include pseudonymisation and
encrypting personal data, ensuring confidentiality, integrity and
availability and resilience of systems, restoring the availability and
access to data after an incident, having process to test, to assess
and to evaluate these systems. The organizational measure include
appointing a data protection officer (PDO) whose responsibility is to guarantee
that data collection is performed according the rules.

People need to give a consent to allow collecting data. Companies
need to show how and when the consent is obtained. The consent can be
explicit or implied by the relationship with the company. In any case,
the collected data must be specific, explicit, and for legiminate
purposes.

If a person is youger than 16, the consent must be asked from the
parent. The member states can lower the age, but it can never be
under 13. 

People can withdraw the given consent at any time and have a right to be
forgotten, if the data is not anymore reguired for original
purposes. In these cases, the collected data must be deleted. People
also have a right to receive collected data in electronic form for
exporting it to another system or service.

In order the data collection to be allowed, the affecting people must know: the
identity and the contact details of the collecting company, the purpose of
data collection and how it is going to be used, if the data will be
transported internationally, how to long data is stored, the
right to correct and erase data, the right to widhraw the consent,
and the right to give a complaint.
