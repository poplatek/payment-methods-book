# Vipps

## About

Vipps is the largest payment application in Norway and it provides the service of paying via using the mobile phone number instead of a bank account number. Vipps was launched in 2015 and it reached 1 million users in a matter of months and counts as many as 2.15 million users and 30 000 corporate customers in early 2017.

Originally owned by DNB the customers of other Norwegian banks have been able to use it and 40% of the users of Vipps are not customers of the DNB. DNB is in the process of spinning off Vipps to more than 100 Norwegian banks to fend off its competitors. DNB will hold 52% and the other banks 48% of Vipps.

The Vipps application has a chat that allows for conversing between participants. If a payment is made to a non-Vipps phone number an SMS will be sent to the receiving mobile phone number and it recommends the mobile phone's owner to install the Vipps app to receive the payment. If they don't, they will not receive the payment.

Vipps seems heavily Norway based, as you require four (4!) Norwegian things to be able to use it: national ID number, national mobile phone number, a nationally issued payment card and a national bank account number.

Vipps is available for Android, Apple and Microsoft.

## Ownership

Vipps was owned by the largest financial concern in Norway, DNB but spinned off in 2017. However, DNB is still the controlling owner (52%) of Vipps. More than 100 Norwegian banks own the other 48%.

After Vipps won in the Norwegian market the ownership was set up like so:
 1. DNB 52%
 2. SpareBank 1 Alliance 25%
 3. the independent savings banks 12%
 4. the Eika Alliance 10%
 5. Sparebanken Møre 1%.

DNB has grown through fusions to be the 72nd largest bank in the world. It's largest owners are the state (34%), DNB Savings Bank Foundation (9%) and a Norwegian pension fund, Folketrygdfondet (~6%).

## Background/History

At launch, users had to pay NOK 1 per transfer up to NOK 2 000 and 1% of the amount for larger transfers. When MobilePay was launched without fees, DNB followed, but retained a fee for transactions over 5 000 NOK.

Vipps was launched by DNB and TCS (Tata).
