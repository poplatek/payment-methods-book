# MobilePay

MobilePay is an application for iOS, Android and Windows phones that allows for payments using a mobile phone number instead of a bank account number. A credit card and a bank account number is bound to the mobile phone number during the registration process.

# Goals

The stated goal of MobilePay is to provide a leading solution for the Nordic markets and to find a way to collaborate with the Swedish Swish. A long term goal of being able to make payments between Swish and MobilePay has been stated.

# Collaboration

Customers of all Finnish banks can use the application. DB has invited all Fennoscandian banks to join in collaboration with MobilePay. Originally MobilePay was created as a solution for DB that decided against national cooperation with Danish banks to build a common app for Denmark. The reasons sited for this decision included the fact that DB did not want to develop a Denmark-only solution.

Finnish Nordea Bank is in collaboration with MobilePay in Denmark and Norway.

DB has stated that it is following the Finnish solution, Siirto, but has not joined it. DB said that MobilePay basically has almost all of the features already that the Finnish Siirto would be offering.

# Weaknesses

MobilePay has a delay in money transfers. In the evenings and over weekend it takes at least one day for the money to be transferred to the target account. Also, MobilePay is not a bank account to bank account transfer system and transfers money from a credit card to a bank account, instead.
