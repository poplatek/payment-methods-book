# Brick and mortar mobile payment methods comparison

## About

The specific use cases can be found from the respective pages of this book that explains the technology for Mobilepay, Vipps, Swish, Dankort mobile and so on. This page is for discussion and comparison of those different ways to address mobile paying in brick and mortar situations. 

## An Important Caveat

The use cases explained in their own respective pages have the caveat that they are based on best available material of which some is meant for advertising purposes and does not therefore necessarily reflect the real world user experience.

One thing that seems to be missing from lots of material is the very beginning of the mobile payment. This includes taking out the phone, perhaps opening a screen lock, starting up the application if it is not already running and then signing into the application which might take a PIN code or perhaps a finger print.

These solution would be needed to test in real life to be certain how this part of the process works on the different technologies. However, there is a video floating around in the Internet that shows some prototype solution that enables a customer to start the payment from a locked screen situation.

Whether that works only if the app has been started previously and perhaps a sign-in into the app has been made also before cannot be deduced from the video but what can be said is that it looked rather handy apart from these caveats.

Perhaps this is Dankort Mobile prototype. Please view the video for yourself to decide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSLH9PvwnDU

## General thoughts

There are many ways to go about the brick and mortar mobile payment situation. Some solution start from the perspective of trying to integrate the new mobile payment solution to the already existing setup at the merchant's shoppe. Some solutions try to completely avoid this in an attempt to bypass all the older systems. There are certainly strenghts and weaknessess to both of these ways of approaching the brick and mortar payment situation.

### Dankort Mobile

Dankort mobile seems to support several payment methods but appears to be, above all, an old school way of going about it. The credit card is put into the mobile phone, so to speak, and a regular NFC payment can be made in the same way as you would w/a credit card.

Dankort mobile goes much further than this, however. There is an additional Bluetooth device that can be added to the existing POS setup which allows for paying via the mobile Dankort app through presenting/tapping the phone to this new device.

There is a new check in/check out solution that lets in some way the customer to first tap their dankort phone to a receiver which start the transaction processing and the transaction completes in one way or the other at the same time the customer is packing their things and completes apparently when the cashier has finished handling the products for this customer.

QR-code is also supported even though it does look somewhat clumsy as a use case and then there is the prototype of starting a purchase from a locked screen situation via the mobile phone which may or may not be a future Dankort mobile product.

The specifics about the use cases seem to depend on the setup. It is a bit different if you have a mobile phone and standalone terminal than it is if you have a integrated payment terminal w/a POS and a bluetooth reader device in addition to the mobile phone.

Also, it may be that the iOS/Apple phone solution differs from the Android solution which is based on the Android HCE technology. The iOS solution may be Bluetooth-based, only.

The Dankort mobile solution is a white label wallet solution for mobile payments. White labeling is supported in order to be able to have the local banks use their logos in the apps to ensure customer loyalty. Overall the Dankort Mobile seems to be based on extending the existing solutions the customers already have at their sales locations.

## Danske Mobilepay

Danske Mobilepay seems to be based on new school thinking. The App comes first.
