# Requirements & Registration

Pivo users need to have a credit card issued by OP, an OP Visa. No bank account is required for basic Pivo usage but if you want to use the Pivo Button ecommerce solution you will need to connect a bank account to your Pivo app.

NFC support is needed on mobile phone (at least for some features?).

# App

# eCommerce: Pivo Button

Pivo supports a button used in web shops / ecommerce. The Pivo button is a multi-bank solution and already has 1 million users in Finland. It works so that you attach your bank account to Pivo while registering and after that you can use the Pivo button in 4000 Finnish web stores.

The payment is taken from credit card but the credit card details are never transferred to the shop keeper for security reasons. The payment goes through Pivo.

# Pivo uses Siirto

Pivo uses the Finnish common Siirto backend and therefore has instant payments between partner banks. See more about that under Siirto.
