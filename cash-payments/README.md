Prevalence of and attitudes towards Cash Payments.

## Fennoscandia

In Fennoscandian nations (Scandinavia plus Finland) 75% of people say that they prefer to pay using a payment card, 15% say they prefer cash and an additional 5% wants to pay using a mobile payment method. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark 72-78% want to pay using a payment card, 13-14% prefer cash and 5-6% prefer mobile paying. Finland differs slightly from the group because while in Finland 71% prefer a payment card, 22% say they prefer cash and just 1% prefers mobile paying.

The value of card payments rose 6% in Norway in 2016. In Norway the drive towards a cashless society is supported by the government, the trade associations and the banks with the stated goal of eliminating the black market.

In Finland Nets declard that the new payment methods are more popular among the younger generations and the more traditional payment methods are more favoured by the more aged cohorts of the population.

In 2017/08 it was reported that 76% of Finns prefer payment cards.

Dankort is used in retail transaction as much as cash in Denmark (2011).

### Resistance towards cashlessness

A 2018 poll in Sweden revealed that 68% of Swedes want to be able to use cash for payments and only 25% support a cashless future for Sweden. Out of Swedes 65 or older 85% want to have the options of using cash while in the 18-29 age range 56% do so. The latter and younger group of Swedes supports cashless-only payments at the level of 38%.

Sweden's central bank also warned in 2018 that Sweden is facing a situation where all payments are controlled by private sector banks. The Riksbank governer called for legislation to secure public control over the payment system which he regards as a public good. He also argues that the control of private banks over all payments is a security risk because the electronic payment systems could become inoperative in crisis situations.

There also exists a movement called Kontantupproret that opposes the cashless society in Sweden and there has been more discussion about it as of late in Swedish politics.

## Europe / European Union

While in the Nordic countries the preference for payment cards is at the level of 75% this is not true for the European Union at large. Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank (ECB) said in 2017 that 75% of transactions in the European Union are done via using cash. In the EU, 76% of people say that they do not wish to give up cash entirely and this rises to 84% for the leading country of Germany. In comparison cash is used in 40% of transaction in Finland.
