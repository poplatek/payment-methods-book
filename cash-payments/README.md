## Fennoscandia

In Fennoscandian nations (Scandinavia plus Finland) 75% of people say that they prefer to pay using a payment card, 15% say they prefer cash and an addition 5% wants to pay using a mobile payment method. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark 72-78% want to pay using a payment card, 13-14% prefer cash and 5-6% prefer mobile paying. Finland differs slightly from the group because while in Finland 71% prefer a payment card, 22% say they prefer cash and just 1% prefers mobile paying.

The value of card payments rose 6% in Norway in 2016. In Norway the drive towards a cashless society is supported by the government, the trade associations and the banks in order to eliminate the black market.

In Finland Nets declard that the new payment methods are more popular among the younger generations and the more traditional payment methods are more favoured by the more aged cohorts of the population.

## Europe / European Union

While in the Nordic countries the preference for payment cards is at the level of 75% this is not true for the European Union at large. Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank (ECB) said in 2017 that 75% of transactions in the European Union are done via using cash. In the EU, 76% of people say that they do not wish to give up cash entirely and this rises to 84% for the leading country of Germany.
