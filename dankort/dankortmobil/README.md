#Dankort Mobile


# Tech

Looks like the an existing Dankort is stored into the mobile phone via a mobile wallet.

The service is available through the mobile apps offered by each of the supporting banks and works on Android handsets through host card emulation (HCE) and on iOS through a Bluetooth acceptance device at the point of sale.

Like NFC, 200 DKK ($30) purchases pinless.

# At store:

“Danish supermarkets are among the first merchants to accept Dankort mobile payments via a Bluetooth acceptance device that sits next to their conventional payment terminals. Following a simple software update to their POS terminals, all merchants that already accept contactless Dankort card payments will also be able to accept Dankort mobile payments.”

# Pricing

Seems free for at least card holders.

# Requirements

- Dankort (perhaps contactless)
- Wallet App from one of the Bokis member banks

# Future

Nets has created a Dankort App for customers of banks that do not have a mobile wallet that works w/Dankort

Now supported for member banks, planned support for regional banks in Denmark.

# Support

Customers of more than 60 banks belonging to The Bokis Partnership have become the first in Denmark to be offered a mobile payment service for Dankort

# Parties

Partnership between Nets and Japanese card issuer JCB in April to enable the launch of a mobile payment service for Dankort in Denmark. A partnership with Spire Payments was announced later in the year.
